# Privacy Evaluation 

The privacy evaluation is done in the jupyter notebook evaluation.ipynb where you can run the different cells one by one to reproduce the results and follow our steps. 
It contains a lot more details than the report which had to be omitted to correspond to the page limit as well as the entire code. 

We took inspiration from this jupyter notebook to write the report with more formal definitions and concise wording. 

We use additional libraries which are added to requirements.txt.
