# Privacy Evaluation 

The privacy evaluation is done in the jupyter notebook evaluation.ipynb where you can run the different cells one by one to reproduce the results and follow our steps. 

We took inspiration from this jupyter notebook to write the report with more formal definitions. 

We use the pandas and folium libraries which are added to requirements.txt. You might need to install them, this can be done using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install folium
```
